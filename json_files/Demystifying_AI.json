Welcome to On the Air with Accounting Today. I'm Editor-in-Chief Dan Hood. It's hard to describe how we all feel about artificial intelligence. It's terrified, we're optimistic, we're confused, we're maybe a little bit hungry now and then. That's really not surprising given how confusing a subject it really is and how many conflicting messages we're getting about it, from wild claims that it will inaugurate the rapture to equally wild claims that it will initiate Armageddon. Here to demystify AI a little bit, particularly as it relates to accounting, is Randy Johnston. He's the Executive Vice President of K2 Enterprise and one of the foremost thinkers and experts on accounting technology in the field. Randy, thanks for joining us. Dan, thank you and welcome to you and all the listeners. Excellent. Well, first off, we should probably start by asking how do you define AI? Everyone has a slightly different definition. Everyone you talk to describes it slightly differently. How do you define it? Yeah, I'm pretty straightforward on this, Dan, but you have to remember technical background. So I have a computer science degree in addition to my other talents. So I tend to be very fussy about a true definition of artificial intelligence. But the whole field of artificial intelligence, which was first defined in 1950, has evolved to today where people are talking about artificial intelligence in the terms of generative AI, the chat, GPT and so forth. But artificial intelligence is actually a collection of algorithms that simulates human intelligence. It's really that simple. I'm always fascinated about it because there is a, at one point, people say, well, it's going to simulate or it imitates or it attempts to reproduce human intelligence. I say, first off, what human intelligence? But I'm always fascinated by this and I realize this wasn't a question we talked about, but I always like to dive into this a little bit. Why do they try to reproduce human intelligence? Why was the thinking let's reproduce human intelligence as opposed to saying let's make something that's intelligent in a very different way? Computers can, in theory, think very differently from human beings. Why do we choose human intelligence as the model there? Well, we're really trying to leverage the talent that we have as people. And if you think about how you come up with new ideas, there is this goal to make artificial intelligence sentient. In other words, just being able to have kind of a personality, a consciousness, if you will. And that's a long-term goal that's been in AI for decades at this point. I figure it's going to be at least another 10 to 15 years before we get close. One of the tests for AI right now is being able to have a conversation like we do and not being able to figure out it's a machine on the other end. That's the Turing test, right? Yeah, it is the Turing test. And being able to have that test for 20 minutes where you can't figure out that you're actually responding with a machine or conversing with a machine. But the human brain is fascinating. If you have not been watching the developments in neurology and neuroscience, the way our brains work is just stunning. The amount of energy that comes in, the output that comes out. And that's the issue related to computing as well. See, today our computers, which are all von Neumann-Turing type of concepts, they're ones and zeros, we're getting ready to make a big jump with quantum computing. And I suspect the way quantum computing is going to be applied to artificial intelligence will give us even more capability than we see today. All right. Well, good answer. That makes sense. Now I understand. Like I said, I always sort of wondered that. Well, with that, let's narrow it down a bit. This is a huge field and it's going to have a huge impact on humanity and the economy and all kinds of broader things like that. But let's narrow it down a little bit to accounting. How do you see it impacting? And I kind of want to break this into a couple of different time periods. How do you see AI impacting accounting sort of today? And then maybe we can take a look a little further out, a couple of years or maybe five years, whatever you're comfortable doing. But let's start with sort of how it's impacting us today. Yeah. And I am happy to take those additional windows. And I think I've got pretty good guesses for you. But today we can leverage it for a lot of routine tasks in accounting. Now I'm going to frame a lot of my discussion around the privacy concerns because the way it works right now is if you provide a prompt, an input, if you will, to AI, the prompt and anything that you put in becomes the property of the company that's providing the AI platform. So if you're using chat GPT, it actually becomes the property of open AI. So you don't want to put client confidential information inside these systems. You don't want to put in financials. You don't want to put in names. But doing simple things like responding to emails or perhaps even creating proposals or scheduling people, many of those types of things are quite doable today. One of the things that you'll want to learn is how to create prompts in this whole area right now is called prompt engineering. And there are techniques and tools to get that job done. But you know, in fact, a recent column I wrote was about how to do a business plan strategy and tactics on using AI. And I actually used AI engines to generate those strategies and tactics. And for the record, less than 45 seconds to do the initial draft. Wow. But you're but no, it's safe to assume you're pretty good at that at the using right at the prompting. I mean, this is a little bit like you have to use to for Google used to have to know if you knew, you know, Boolean operators and stuff like that. That was a really useful skill for that. I was in a similar kind of thing like how to how to use the system to ask it the right questions to deliver the answers you need. That's exactly right. And it turns out the creativity here is really the key. If you can dream of it, there's a good chance that AI can produce an answer in it. And I've been asking accountants to generally think about the things that are time consuming to them and ask the generative AI engines to help them respond. And see, I think there's going to be a major difference in accountants that use AI versus accountants that don't use AI. And good accountants will be able to leverage their skills and be able to check the AI results. But realistically, I don't think I start any of my tasks now that I don't ask an AI engine for some guidance. And it really eliminates that blank paper syndrome where you're starting with nothing at all. You get to start with something. Now, I worry about that a little bit, Dan, because we know that human intelligence generates creative new ideas seemingly out of midair. But the fact of the matter is, AI is actually going to narrow and channel. And that's a risk of using AI for this starting point. Well, but then but then there are plenty of things where we talk about human creativity and it is a beautiful and great thing and we want to maintain it. But there's plenty of tasks that people do every day that really don't require like it's not Michelangelo painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. It's a marketing email or it's an introduction to a request for proposal kind of thing where it's just you just need, as you say, the blank page. You're like, I need some words to start this. And they don't need to be perfect. They don't need to be the preamble of the Constitution. It just needs to be adequately correct in English and get my point across. Right. So there's a lot of room for that. A lot of room for that. In fact, I usually prompt accountants just think about that mundane and boring stuff that they have to get done and assume that AI is going to be an intelligence assistant that you can train to become even better over time. And as you use AI more and teach the AI engine how you work and think, the AI responses will be even better for you. So the simple way for most of you is just think about the top five or top ten things that you just kind of wish I didn't have to do and start using AI to do those things. And you'll find you can do them in much less time. Now, Dan, you know us from being public speakers and writers and that type of thing. But I can tell you in this year, when I wrote my CPE courses, I did not write a single review question. And you know, in the CPE world, you actually have to generate five review questions per hour and all that stuff and matching two objectives. I've written over 500 review questions this year, all in AI. And I only had to edit one of them. Other than that, they were frankly better than I could write. And I'm actually trained in educational behavioral psychology. So I actually know how to write objectives correctly and how to write, you know, test questions correctly. And it's like, this stuff is stunning. Now, you've met my wife too, and she's also trained in education. And I showed her how these bloody questions were being generated. And she said, Oh, my. So maybe we'll do George Takei. Oh, my. Oh, my. So you're fitting your basic, I'm assuming you're feeding in your your course materials or to it and saying, give me some questions based on this. And actually, in many cases, if I'm going to write a course, I'll say I'm going to write a course on this topic, I'm going to focus it on accounting professionals. I have a description that looks roughly like this. Give me objectives that, you know, behavioral objectives that meet the criterion that we have to use. And it'll generate the objectives and I'll look at those and say, yeah, not quite. We'll fix these a little bit. OK, now I'm going to use these objectives. Now write 10 questions, multiple choice that meet these objectives, identify the objectives, identify the right answer. Out they come. It is stunning how good it is. But you know, more on the point of day to day accounting tasks, you know, if you begin to realize that things that are thrown onto your plate or that you delegate to others in your organization, you could actually delegate some of those things to a generative tool and it will come back with an answer in almost real time. And that part of it could even be more efficient than a delegation to another staff member. Or if you've got staff members that are trained in using AI, they can come up with far better draft results for you to review in a very, very short period of time. And let's use the proposal that you had. You know, there's a lot of proposals that are generated for different activities and you can write proposals in the style of your business or firm by simply providing a prior proposal and say, you know, I need to write a proposal. Here's an example of one I've written in the past. This is Randy writing. Again, here's my writing style or this is firm A, B or C and here's our style. Write a proposal for these situations with this parameters in the same style. It'll fill it out. That's amazing. Now, it's interesting. We could spend a lot of time on a lot of things here. There's a lot of rabbit holes I could go down. One quick one I want to go with on this one is right now, everyone's big model of AI is chat GPT, right, and chat GPT. And correct me if I'm wrong because I could well be. It seems like a lot of the function of chat GPT is language generation, right? It is it's it as you say, it can take your style, your writing style and your presentation style and mimic it. I've seen people, you know, say, write me this speech in the in the in the style of a cockney urchin from the 1890s and it did a pretty good job of bringing in cockney slang, that sort of stuff. But it's it's not necessarily, for instance, it doesn't know it's I don't know how good it is at math, for instance. I know it's very good at breaking down language and reproducing it and finding patterns within language and that sort of stuff. But is is this is chat GPT really the model we should be looking at or is it should be one model of something that would apply in a lot of different ways? Yeah, it is clearly poor at math and accounting. OK, so the current generative models you should not use in that way. Now I want to fork people's thinking in this because what you'll discover is predictive analytics can be an AI that is useful in these types of financial pieces. But because of the way the large language models that are behind these generative AI products work, they really work in four separate steps. They do tokenization first, then they do embedding, then they have what's known as an attention model to select the words that they're going to respond with, and then they do completion. It's a four step process in most of these current models. And the issue is it's just a game of statistics. How often does this word come up in the context of these other words? So just like you and I are talking here, Dan, if you and notice you probably completed the word you before I said it and I paused with intent for our listeners on that. But notice you have a pretty good idea what's going to be said next because you understand the English language in the context of our sentence. Well, that's what's happening in AI. But it is smart because it is crawled a predefined section of the Internet. You know, the large crawl model that was used between 2016 and 2019 to feed most of the generative AI engines right now have extracted a lot of the content of the Internet. And notably, it is English speaking biased because of the crawl itself. But it is limited in scope in that way. So you have to watch in many of the models, chat, GPT in specific, it has not supplied things past September 2021. The application of chat GPT into the Bing Microsoft search engines is completing some of the more current pieces. But you have to recognize until we get full Internet search and completion capability through current, you always have a little bit of a historical bias. Right. Well, I know my things to say if it's only to 2021, it won't it won't know the latest accounting standards or the latest tax regulations or that sort of thing. And then even if it does know them, it might just make them up. It might just hallucinate them, which is a whole other terrifying, terrifying issue. But I want to I want to look at move from now. I think that's a great picture of where we are now. Maybe start to look forward and maybe as we look forward just to because it's we could we could speculate for for I can speculate wildly. You could give informed speculation as to the future in a wide, wide range of things. But maybe if we focus on a couple of areas, one would be the issue of of ownership. You talked about if you put stuff in in chat, you bet it's effectively owned by OpenAI in terms of how those things are, how that's going to work out. Maybe we talk a little bit about the hallucination issue and whether that's going to be fixed or or how that might be fixed in part because you say when you're putting in your courses to get your questions, you know your courses so you can read those questions and go, oh yeah, that's terrible. What did why did they put that in there? That makes no sense. Whereas there's the famous story of the lawyer who did a brief, had AI do a brief for a for a case and it made up a case just at a whole cloth, not even misinterpreted, made it up, which is bizarre, but also suggests that the computers are dreaming. So maybe those two in particular, but then also and then, you know, maybe what happens when we move beyond chat GPT is our main idea of what AI is. Yes. So let's take it out three to five years as you had suggested earlier. And there is already indications that the current large language models have reached their limits. So there's going to have to be new models built and they are being built on a regular basis. Last numbers I saw, Dan, was that there have been 29 new commercial models this year, three new educational models. And I think there's probably more than that. Those are just the ones I'm aware of. Now, what you can expect is that the precision of the models will become better. You can expect that there will be more private models. And of course, Microsoft Copilot 365 pricing is finally available $30 per user per month on top of the E3, E5 platforms. So many of us will have it as part of our Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote suite. So you can expect that if you're writing a document in Word, that you can prepare a presentation from it just by saying, go do it. And that has actually been demonstrated and is live today in the Microsoft 365 platform. But what I believe will happen is the privacy will begin to kick in. And there are a number of models that are available. The Alpaca model from Stanford, the Lama model. Facebook has said that they're going to keep their AI engine public and so forth. You'll be able to install your own AI engine for your firm or for your business and keep the data private. And that's actually a big step forward. Now, the other part of these models, Dan, is tuning them up. Today in chat GPT, there is a feature known as reinforcement learning from human feedback, RLHF. It's actually presented with a little finger or thumb. And if it's right, you're supposed to actually click that and it improves the model. But a lot of people are doing that right now. And there is concern on alignment problems. That's really what you're talking about when we're dealing with hallucination and making stuff up from whole cloth. We know that techniques used for wargaming or red teaming are being applied. But there is concern from the very best of the developers that it's going to be hard to make the models more accurate. And Sam Bowman from New York University and Anthropic has said it's going to get harder as the systems get better. So I'm actually concerned about that. And even with the newly formed AI group that's trying to set AI standards, right now, the computer scientists behind these models just don't know how they can do some of the things that they're doing. And that's another one of those like, how is that possible? Well, then stop doing it if you don't know how you're doing it. This is how we got dinosaurs at Jurassic Park. I'm just saying. I think so. And that's, you know, those talents are called emergent capabilities. But here's what I'd like for you to think about from accounting. You can expect that the models will become predictive, that you'll be able to do things that are routine, like forecasting in confidence and in private. So that'll become very natural. You know, I'm a big fan of advisory services. I believe that you'll actually be able to analyze businesses and apply appropriate strategies to make them more profitable, make them run easier, improve their processes. Things like scheduling will become easier to do. So what I want you to do is start thinking about processes that you're doing today and how they can be optimized by AI. Excellent. All right. There's so much more to talk about. But we need to take a quick break and then we'll come right back.

All right. And we're back. We're talking with Randy Johnston of K2 Enterprises, all about artificial intelligence, what it is, where it's going. And we've got a great sense of its direction and encouraged by, as you talk about things like better security or better able to control your data when you work with AI, being able to have your own private AI is encouraging from that perspective. Little discouraged about the whole, we're not sure how we do this and we're not sure how to fix it kind of thing. But hopefully they're working on that now. Let's go a little bit even more narrowly into accounting. And I want to talk specifically about accounting software because it seems like every day some vendor comes out and says, hey, we've got AI. We're using AI. We're all about AI and you're never sure how much AI they're actually using and what they're applying it to. And there are a gazillion vendors and some of them genuinely are right out at the cutting edge or the bleeding edge of AI research. And then there's others who've basically bought a license to chat GPT and integrated that into their thing. So it's a huge spectrum. I realize that. So this is a wildly unfair question. But in general, do you have a sense of where the vendors in the accounting space are? They really wrapped their heads around AI? You know, obviously, like I said, I know there'll be outliers on either end. But how you know, where where are they in terms of this? Well, I appreciate the wildly unfair question, Dan, because I think I can actually give you an opinion on it. And I think some basis in fact, which is probably the more important thing here. So first off, for our listeners, just to get them think about this, the algorithms behind AI, the quantity of algorithms developed are pretty stunning. Early on, there were only about 30 to 50 AI algorithms. And today there's well over 500. Many of these are in the public space and can be used and reused openly. On the other hand, a number of vendors have been developing their own private AI algorithms. Now, when it comes to all of this AI, there's actually a chain of neural networks, which work kind of like our brains, machine learning, which a lot of the vendors are using and calling it AI. But I don't consider machine learning AI. It's a branch of it, but it's not the real deal. And then there's the AI algorithms. So the question really becomes when I'm vetting products, Dan, how many AI algorithms are you using? Number one. And number two, how many have you developed yourself? OK, now that as the framework, then we can go back to the providers, to the profession, the big boys, the Walters-Kluehers, the Intuits, the Thomson-Reuters. And we can ask what algorithms are inside their platforms. And we do see evidence of AI being applied, let's say inside Checkpoint Engage. We also see that inside some of the Walters-Kluehers tools. We see much more machine learning inside the Intuit platforms. Now I know in another podcast we are discussing the accounting software, but I'll just throw accounting software vendors into a pool together. And most accounting software products that are out there don't really have AI. Everybody's trying to hook their bandwagon to the AI moniker. And I politely just call that fake AI like we heard of fake news or fake advisory in the past. It's really just marketing BS. And you have to be very, very cautious because everybody's saying they've got AI. And it might be machine learning and it might be some predecessor, but it may not be a true AI. Gotcha. So that's something. But in theory, that's something we should expect them to be doing more and more. Would you expect over time a lot of that fake AI to go away and be replaced by genuine AI? Or are they just never going to get it? No, they actually will get it. And this is under non-disclosure, so I can't speak about it directly. But I am aware of a new platform that is completely AI-driven that will support the tax marketplace. It'll be announced later this year. And but I'm also aware of a number of products that you would know of and their AI efforts. And the best way to think about it is the developers are looking at ways to apply AI with their engines and they're basically peeling off one of the public domain models. They're plugging their product against it and then they're using that AI engine in a private fashion to generate responses. So as an example here, Dan, the Corvi tax planning product actually has connected a true AI engine to produce tax planning guidance. That's kind of interesting. Now, is it still early in the process? Sure. But I can probably now name 10 or 12 products that have good solid beta tests running of applying AI to do specialized items inside their software platform. Excellent. Good. And as you say, we can expect more and more of them to be adding this, right? So it's not just fake AI forever and real AI over here, but they'll all converge on something real. A good way for our listeners to think about that, Dan, is think about the evolution of the web and think what websites were like early on and how they got better and how mobile apps were clunking, got better and so forth. We're at a very, very early stage of AI. And right now, many of the development teams were caught flat footed. I think the reason we saw the letter that was signed by tens of thousands of developers where they actually got caught flat footed and wanted six months to be able to catch up. Well, we're in a period where a lot of these companies now get it and they're trying to catch up. You've got some innovators, you've got some laggards. And in fact, I refer to that as type one and type two AI. Type one's enhancing your product and type two is new revolutionary types of results. And we can expect to see more and more of those as more and more people get get up to speed on it once that six month elapses. So let's just bring this up. Who's developing it internally? There are accounting firms and mostly the big four firms that are developing their own proprietary AIs internally. And this research that leads me to my next question, which is when accountants think about this, this thing, do accountants need to be building AI themselves? Is this a thing they need to be focusing on? Or is it the kind of thing where they can just expect that it will be built into a lot of the tools they're going to use? And maybe there'll be AI engines that they can sort of buy off the shelf to supply other needs. I mean, do they need to be working? Does a firm need to have its own proprietary AI? I'm leaving aside the big four. I understood on that, and I think my simple answer is most of us do not need to build these platforms ourselves. I believe that you will find enough high quality AI tools to use that you can train on your own methodologies that they'll produce favorable results for your for your firm or business. And we can go back to the simple Microsoft Copilot 365 example, but we can also go to these private generative tools that we might host. And so today, if you use the 3.5 chat, open AI 3.5 chat GPT model, you can put up a private database and load it with all of your proposals and your methodologies and so forth. And it will begin acting like your firm acts. And that's a very simple installation. At the risk of sounding a little too technical, it's only like a 600 gig library to install and it runs very, very straightforward and you can privatize it. So I expect some of it to be done that way. But you know, the vendors themselves will each have an offering and they'll be responsible for controlling the privacy. But just recognize that privacy is still an issue. There's currently I would call it a rumor, but it's actually got confirmation that even Microsoft is having trouble controlling the AI content across instances of 365. So I have my K2 instance of 365. You have yours at at Arizona. You're running there. You put in something in your engine and all of a sudden I can see it over in my engine. Not good, right? Yeah. It's not real common, but there are situations like that. So this whole issue of privacy and hallucinations, those two are the biggest threats on these platforms. But I expect three to five years, a lot of those will get worked out. And in the meantime, there's plenty you can do without putting your private information, right? Private client information, as we talked about all kinds of marketing things or just general writing tasks that you do every day that don't require any proprietary information or data or anything like that. But you just make things a lot easier. And Dan, it's very straightforward on this one, by the way, everyone should have an AI initiative, regardless of your size. If you're even a sole proprietor, but if you're a small firm, you need to have a little bit of time set aside to understand what the tool can do for you. And I believe that you will be rewarded with time leverage because the time you invest in it will come back to you in results that you can use. So it's time to be learning and I can't imagine any business that shouldn't have a little bit of an AI initiative, regardless of size. No, it certainly well, just in the same way that at some point somebody recently said, all businesses are now technology businesses, right? To a certain extent, all businesses are going to be AI businesses one way or another. It's going to touch everything. I want to just sort of give us a final thought of how accounts could be talking about it. I think you've given us some clear clues, right? One is it sounds like you don't need to be building your own AI. You don't need to know how to build an AI, but you do need to know how to use it, whether it's prompt engineering, learning that now. And I always wonder about prompt engineering, whether it will be sort of like I said, like Boolean operators for Google. No one needs to do any of those anymore because Google's gotten a lot better at finding things for you. And so a lot of that early stuff went away, but for now prompt engineering. But then for later on, it's just that things like what can it do for us? How can this impact your business? What can we hand off to AI given the war for talent and all that sort of stuff? There are other things you think accountants should be thinking about just as a final takeaway that they should be thinking about it when they think about AI. Yeah. So first thing I'll do is just respond to saying, think about your own personal situation. Think about all the things that are problematic. We've kind of identified this earlier in the discussion, but I would suggest you go after your top three time consuming items, whatever those are. So I would personalize that first. But once you get past that and you begin to learn how the platform works, then I would turn it towards your firm's needs or perhaps downstream to your client's needs if you're in public practice or your customer's need if you're in industry and say, what is it that our clients could benefit from? And I would begin building tools and methodologies to support your clients or your customers. To me, that's where it really works. Now, I'll flip it up with just one little other piece. We know that talent is short and I have taken a much more team first, our employee first mentality on this. Look around at your team and say, how could I make all of my team members' efforts easier? And I think you will discover right away that AI can do that. It doesn't necessarily have to be a young tech savvy person. You can almost go person by person and say, what could I use AI for with that person and help build that and help teach them that. Wow, very cool. Excellent. I hadn't even thought about when you throw out the idea of what can your clients or your customers do with it. That's a whole advisory service right there. We'll come in and tell you how AI can improve your business. And it's only going to be a bigger and bigger opportunity as time goes by. Well, this is a great conversation. I could pump you for information and ideas and thoughts for days and days and days because you've got a lot of them and it's always fascinating to talk to you. But unfortunately, we have to go. So I want to say, Randy, Johnson, awesome stuff. Thank you for joining us. Very pleased to do so, Dan. And I look forward to speaking with you and your listeners again. Cheers. All right.

He defines AI as a collection of algorithms that simulate human intelligence. Johnston highlights that AI can be leveraged for routine tasks in accounting, such as responding to emails, creating proposals, and scheduling. He suggests that accountants should think about processes that can be optimized by AI and identify the top time-consuming tasks that can be delegated to AI. Johnston also mentions that accounting software vendors are starting to incorporate AI into their products, and he advises accountants to be cautious of vendors claiming to have AI without actually using it effectively.
